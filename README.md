# Preswald_App
This is an app I made for the Preswald coding assessment. I used an NHIS dataset with data about health estimates for adults 18 and over from the National Health Interview Survey.
First, I installed Preswald, created a new project, and ran the program. When I did, I saw an error message that said that no component was registered for the text/html mimetype. I tried to fix the problem, but I was not able to find a solution. I tried installing older versions of Python, clearing the browser cache, and running the program in Incognito mode, but I still had the same problem. I was still able to edit the hello.py file according to the guide, add an interactive dashboard, and export the project in HTML format.
